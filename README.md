## Brief CDA - Shell Script - 10/11/26
 
### Console
 
The console is the physical device used for communication between the user and the system.
 
### Terminal
 
The terminal is the interface used to interact with the console.
 
### Shell
 
A shell is a program that interpret and processes the commands given by the user.
 
### Command and arguments
 
A command is an instruction given via an interface.
A command can support arguments to specify or modify its default behavior.
 
The command is processed by the shell, reading each words separated by a blank space. 
It is then interpreted, and executed.
For example:
 - if i type "echo hello" the shell sees two words 'echo' and 'hello'

- it interprets the words: 'echo' is known as a command that prints an argument and 'hello' is the argument given to print
 
- it executes: the shell returns the word given in argument to the echo command, displaying
'hello'
